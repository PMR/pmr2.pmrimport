      <p>
        This requested model, <span tal:replace="view/model_name"/>, is
        no longer available at this location as PMR2 has replaced the
        decommissioned software, PMR, on 2009-06-22.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are interested in the original, unprocessed model file
        as it resided in PMR, it can be found with its supporting 
        documentation and image(s) at <a href="" 
        tal:attributes="href view/workspace_rev_uri;">this revision</a>
        of its <a href="" tal:attributes="href view/workspace_uri;"
        >PMR2 workspace</a>.  PMR2 Workspaces are the storage components
        for models and their associated data in this repository 
        software.
      </p>

      <tal:if tal:condition="view/related_exposures">
      <p>
        If you are interested in the presentational pages that are 
        similar to the ones found the previous repository, the following
        is a list of pages that are derived from later revision(s) of 
        this <a href="" tal:attributes="href view/workspace_uri;"
        >model's workspace</a>.  
      </p>

             tal:content="i/Title"></a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As the requested model revision was not the latest available as
        of 2009-06-22, the presentational pages were not regenerated
        when this model was migrated into PMR2.  Also, please be advised
        that these pages may appear differently as compared to their
        original appearance in the previous software, as continuous
        improvements to the presentational modules in PMR2 may result in
        more data being extracted and presented than in the previous
        software.

        If you are interested in the presentational pages that are

        did not have its presentational pages regenerated or they are 
        temporarily not found.  Please check back later or visit the
