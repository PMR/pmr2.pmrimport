<p>
  The requested model, <span tal:replace="view/model_name"/>, was part 
  of the CellML Model Repository running on PMR1.  Due to ongoing 
  developments, PMR1 had been decommissioned and replaced by PMR2.  The
  model and associated data had been migrated, but its associated
  presentational page (now called Exposure) was not regenerated for this
  version of the model.

<tal:if tal:condition="view/related_exposures">
  <p>
    However, Exposure(s) had been made for later versions of this model.
    They are listed below.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li tal:repeat="i view/related_exposures">
      <a tal:attributes="href i/getURL"
         tal:content="i/Title"></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</tal:if>

<tal:if tal:condition="not:view/related_exposures">
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the latest Exposures may be temporary unavailable or
    had not been regenerated.  Please check back later.

  The original version of this model that was located here is now stored 
  as a revision within its workspace.  You may find its associated 
  diagrams and data at: <a href="" 
    tal:attributes="href view/workspace_uri" 
    tal:content="view/workspace_uri"></a>.
